# EMPR

This is my EMPR Project currently we are completing mini challenges to prepare us for the larger graded project in spring term.

The goal for these mini projects is to give us experience using the mBed and general io board provided. I also aim to use the code written in the mini projects as a library for the main project e.g. using the LEDS as error codes by simply passing an int into a error throwing function inside the LEDS.c file
